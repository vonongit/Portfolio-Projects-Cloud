## 🚨 The Problem

StartupCo had **10 employees** all using the same root account credentials shared through insecure channels. This created several critical security risks:

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| ❌ **No Accountability** | Impossible to track who performed which actions |
| ❌ **Excessive Permissions** | Everyone had full admin access to all resources |
| ❌ **No MFA** | Zero multi-factor authentication requirements |
| ❌ **No Password Policy** | Weak or reused passwords across the team |
| ❌ **Single Point of Failure** | One compromised credential = entire AWS account at risk |

---

## ✅ The Solution

Built a comprehensive IAM security infrastructure implementing the **principle of least privilege** with:

- ✨ **4 IAM Groups** with role-specific permissions
- 👥 **10 Individual User Accounts** with unique credentials
- 🔒 **MFA Enforcement** for all users
- 📊 **CloudTrail Logging** for complete audit trails
- 🛡️ **Strong Password Policy** (14+ chars, complexity requirements, 90-day rotation)
- 🏷️ **Tag-Based Access Control** for resource isolation

## 🔑 Key Security Features

### 1. 🔐 MFA Enforcement
Users cannot perform any actions until MFA is enabled on their account.

### 2. 🏷️ Tag-Based Access Control
Developers can only modify resources tagged with `Environment=development`, preventing accidental production changes.

### 3. 📝 CloudTrail Audit Logging
Complete audit trail of all AWS API calls with encrypted S3 storage.

### 4. 🔒 Strong Password Policy
- Minimum 14 characters
- Requires uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- 90-day password rotation
- Prevents password reuse

### 5. 🪣 Secure S3 Storage
CloudTrail logs stored in encrypted S3 bucket with strict access controls.

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### Challenge 1: MFA Policy Lockout
**Problem:** Initial MFA policy locked all IAM users out before they could set up MFA.

**Solution:** Added exceptions for `iam:GetUser` and `iam:ChangePassword` to allow users to sign in and configure MFA on first login.

```hcl
# Allow users to manage their own MFA devices
"iam:*MFADevice",
"iam:GetUser",
"iam:ChangePassword"
```

### Challenge 2: Developer Permission Scope
**Problem:** Finding the right balance - developers needed enough access to work effectively without risking production resources.

**Solution:** Implemented tag-based conditional access. Developers can only interact with resources tagged `Environment=development`.

```hcl
"Condition": {
  "StringEquals": {
    "aws:ResourceTag/Environment": "development"
  }
}
```

### Challenge 3: Audit Trail Implementation
**Problem:** Ensuring CloudTrail logs couldn't be tampered with or deleted by unauthorized users.

**Solution:** Created dedicated S3 bucket with encryption and bucket policies preventing deletion, even by ops team.
